schema registry. The skill lives at skills/glean-cli/SKILL.md as a navigation
hub; per-command detail files (flags tables, subcommands, examples) are written
to skills/glean-cli/reference/<command>.md and loaded on demand.

The generator is idempotent and will clean up any legacy skills/glean-cli-<cmd>/
directories from earlier layouts.

Run this after adding or modifying commands to keep skills in sync.
