## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- CI: skip `TestStateDir_FilePermissions` on Windows — Unix permission bits are not enforced on Windows
- Remove `glean version` subcommand in favour of the conventional `--version` flag

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Update notifications: after each command, a background goroutine checks the GitHub releases API (cached for 24h in `~/.glean/update-check.json`) and prints a notice to stderr when a newer version is available

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `--version` flag on the root command (via Cobra built-in)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Add `--dry-run` flag to `documents get-permissions`, `answers get`, and `shortcuts get` — these were inconsistently missing the flag vs their sibling subcommands

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `User-Agent: glean-cli/<version>` header on all outbound HTTP requests (both SDK-routed and streaming chat), allowing Glean's backend to identify and attribute CLI traffic by version

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Full release pipeline: GoReleaser with cosign signing, CycloneDX SBOM, Homebrew tap publishing
- Checksum verification in `install.sh`
- `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability disclosure process
- `--version` / `--help` flag improvements

### Fixed
- Release workflow now gates GoReleaser on tests and lint passing
- `glean chat --json --dry-run` now correctly includes `stream: true`
- All delete/remove subcommands now support `--dry-run`
- `documents get-by-facets`, `entities read-people`, `messages get` now support `--dry-run`
- README Quick Start uses correct full hostname format and includes auth as step 0
- `glean chat --timeout` help text corrected to reflect 60s default
- Error messages across namespace commands now include `--help` guidance

  - Streaming chat with live stage indicators (Searching / Reading / Writing)
  - Slash commands: `/mode auto|fast|advanced`, `/clear`, `/help`
  - `@filename` file attachment support
  - Session persistence with `--continue` flag
  - `ctrl+y` to copy last response
- `glean mcp` stdio MCP server exposing `glean_search`, `glean_chat`, `glean_schema`, `glean_people`
- `--fields` dot-path projection for search and namespace commands
- Agent skill files in `skills/`

## [0.2.x] - 2025-2026

### Added
